## Overview

The Random Item Mod will randomly choose a block when enabled. Activate the mod using [R]. All keys are rebindable.

## Features

### 1. Intuitive Item Selection

Effortlessly navigate through item selections using the [J] and [K] keys. Customize your randomization experience by handpicking specific items from your inventory, ensuring that only the blocks you desire make it into the rotation.

### 2. Inclusive Randomization of Tools

Extend the randomness beyond blocks to include tools. This is probably only useful very rarely.

### 3. Weighted Probability Selection

Experience a fair and balanced approach to randomization, where the likelihood of an item being chosen is directly proportional to its count in your inventory. The more you have, the higher the chance it becomes the next randomly placed item.

## How does it work?
The mod will place the randomly chosen item into the offhand. Ensure that your main hand is empty so the item will be used. If you are using this mod on a server, it might be considered cheating. Make sure the mod is allowed first.
